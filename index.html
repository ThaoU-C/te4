    <p> This work was created as an NFT from a picture taken when Bi took Helen for a walk.<br>
        Dog ownership in the US carries an attractive aura that speaks beyond just having a pet.<br>
        Walking a dog through the neighborhood enhances the owner's image as friendly, active, and stable.<br>
        The artwork was painted in Photoshop to demonstrate the perception of the dog-owner relationship.
